# Notification System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing API Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/notifications/unread/count` but backend only had `/notifications/unread`
**Fix**: Added `getUnreadCount` controller method and route

### 2. HTTP Method Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend used `PATCH` but backend only supported `PUT` for marking notifications as read
**Fix**: Added support for both `PUT` and `PATCH` methods in routes

### 3. Incorrect Data Structure
**Problem**: Frontend expected `{ count: number }` but backend returned array
**Fix**: Modified `getUnreadCount` to return `{ count }` object

### 4. Frontend Logic Errors
**Problem**: 
- Missing `else` clause in NotificationBadge component
- Incorrect property names (`read` vs `isRead`)
- Missing error handling
**Fix**: 
- Fixed conditional rendering logic
- Corrected property names to match backend response
- Added proper error handling and fallbacks

### 5. Notification Creation Logic Issues
**Problem**: 
- Notification creation was based on Order model but status is in OrderDetails
- Incorrect association names (`OrderDetails` vs `OrderDetail`)
- Missing proper data relationships
**Fix**:
- Updated `createOrderNotification` to properly include all related models
- Fixed association names to use correct aliases
- Added comprehensive logic for different notification scenarios

### 6. Missing Notification Triggers
**Problem**: Notifications were only created on order creation, not on updates
**Fix**: Added notification triggers to:
- Order updates (`updateOrder`)
- Payment status changes (`updatePaymentStatus`)

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `src/controllers/notificationController.js` - Added missing endpoints and fixed logic
- `src/routes/notificationRoutes.js` - Added missing routes and HTTP method support

### 3. Info Notifications (‚ÑπÔ∏è)

## API Endpoints
