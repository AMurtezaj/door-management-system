# Frontend Partial Payment Implementation Guide

## Overview

The frontend has been successfully updated to support partial payments for both main orders and supplementary orders. The implementation includes a reusable modal component and updated service functions.

## âœ… **Components Updated**

### 1. **PartialPaymentModal** (New Component)
- **Location**: `src/components/payments/PartialPaymentModal.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Reusable for both main orders and supplementary orders
  - Real-time payment calculation and validation
  - Overpayment protection
  - Payment preview with remaining debt calculation
  - Auto-completion detection when debt reaches zero

### 2. **OrderList Component**
- **Location**: `src/components/orders/OrderList.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added partial payment modal state
  - Updated "Paguaj" button to open payment modal instead of simple toggle
  - Added `handlePartialPayment()` and `handlePartialPaymentSuccess()` functions
  - Integrated PartialPaymentModal component

### 3. **SupplementaryOrdersList Component**
- **Location**: `src/components/orders/SupplementaryOrdersList.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added partial payment modal state
  - Updated payment buttons to use partial payment functionality
  - Added partial payment handler functions
  - Integrated PartialPaymentModal component

## âœ… **Service Functions Updated**

### 1. **orderService.js**
- Added `addPartialPayment(id, paymentAmount, paymentReceiver)` function
- Calls `POST /api/orders/:id/partial-payment` endpoint

### 2. **supplementaryOrderService.js**
- Added `addPartialPaymentToSupplementaryOrder(id, paymentAmount, paymentReceiver)` function
- Calls `POST /api/supplementary-orders/:id/partial-payment` endpoint

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

### User Flow:
1. **User clicks "Paguaj" button** â†’ Opens PartialPaymentModal
2. **Modal displays**:
   - Order information (ID, total price, amount paid so far)
   - Remaining debt prominently displayed
   - Payment amount input field
   - Payment receiver input field
   - Real-time payment preview

3. **User enters payment amount**:
   - Validation prevents overpayment
   - Shows remaining debt after payment
   - Indicates if order will be fully paid

4. **User submits payment**:
   - API call to backend
   - Order list updates automatically
   - Success message displayed
   - Modal closes

### Key Features:
- **Smart Validation**: Prevents negative amounts and overpayments
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows payment impact before submission
- **Auto-completion**: Detects when order becomes fully paid
- **Error Handling**: Displays backend validation errors
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### Modal Props:
```javascript
<PartialPaymentModal
  show={showModal}
  onHide={() => setShowModal(false)}
  order={selectedOrder}                    // For main orders
  supplementaryOrder={selectedSupOrder}    // For supplementary orders
  onPaymentSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
/>
```

### Payment Success Handler:
```javascript
const handlePartialPaymentSuccess = async ({ 
  orderId, 
  paymentAmount, 
  paymentReceiver, 
  isSupplementaryOrder 
}) => {
  // Update order in state
  // Show success message
  // Refresh data if needed
};
```

### API Response Format:
```javascript
{
  "message": "Pagesa prej â‚¬150.50 u regjistrua me sukses!",
  "order": { /* updated order data */ }
}
```
